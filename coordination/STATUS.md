# STATUS — overnight/integration live board

**Captain:** Agent 12 · **Branch:** `overnight/integration` · **Base:** `4863a0c` (main)
**HEAD:** `fcffae1` · **Last updated:** 2026-06-26 (Captain — integration cycle 2 complete)

## 🏁 MILESTONE: all 11 agents re-merged to latest · gate GREEN
Cycle 1 first-merged all 11; **cycle 2 re-merged all 11 to their latest** (deterministic CSS
per CAPTAIN-PLAYBOOK; re-parented A7's migration to collapse a 2-head alembic fork; A8's DoD#2
before/after screenshots landed). Tree green both ends. Residual pending (agents committed during
the sweep): A6+4, A5/A7/A10+1 → next cycle. See MERGE-LOG cycle 2.

## 🚦 GATE: GREEN ✅
- Frontend: `pnpm --filter @kinora/desktop typecheck && build` → **green** (CSS 73 kB).
- Backend: `make test` → **408 passed, 139 skipped, 0 failures**.
- Bonus (NOT in hard gate): desktop `vitest` → **64 tests pass**; **7 test files fail to load**
  ("No test suite found" / non-vitest style) — A9 (settings, glyphs, symbol), A10 (crossfade,
  fallback, machine), A2 (timeline). Tracked in each agent's request queue; not a blocker.

## 📣 Agents: pull the rails + keep your tests vitest-shaped
`git merge overnight/integration` (clean tree) to get: the **`src/styles/` split** (edit *your*
partial; aggregator + `main.tsx` are the Captain's), the **`api.ts` `http`/`BASE`** primitives
(CONTRACTS §7 — A3: drop your private `lib/api/http.ts`, import `{ http } from "../api"`), and
**`coordination/`**. Write `*.test.ts` with vitest `describe/it/expect` so they register.

## Per-agent board (cycle 1)
| Agent | Branch | Integrated | Pending re-merge | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `agent/01-event-director` | ✅ `b2f9709` | +4 | render pipeline (backend) |
| A2 | `agent/02-scroll-film` | ✅ `49b6cf6` | 0 | timeline + scroll engine; Captain fixed demo prefs drift |
| A3 | `agent/03-film-api` | ✅ `fb7d6d0` | +1 | films router registered; uses own http.ts (converge to §7) |
| A4 | `agent/04-motion` | ✅ `c4b13c1` | +3 | motion system |
| A5 | `agent/05-library` | ✅ `3190158` | 0 | library+covers+migration (single head); frontend pending |
| A6 | `agent/06-a11y` | ✅ `a123564` | +5 | a11y layer + vitest infra |
| A7 | `agent/07-optim` | ✅ `7614f84` | +1 | optim modules (default-off); patch proposals pending |
| A8 | `agent/08-design` | ✅ `d7825ea` | +1 | design tokens (keystone) |
| A9 | `agent/09-settings-icons` | ✅ `7d5afad` | +3 | icons + settings |
| A10 | `agent/10-reading-room` | ✅ `20a359e` | 0 | reading shell + state machine |
| A11 | `agent/11-login` | ✅ `aa2b406` | 0 | login/auth + BookWall |

**Steady state:** agents keep committing; the Captain re-merges (git rerere auto-applies the
seam resolutions). "Pending" = commits on the branch not yet in integration → next re-merge sweep.

## Merge order (dependency) — cycle 1 done in: A9,A4,A8,A6,A1,A7,A10,A2,A3,A5,A11
`A8 → A6 → A4 → A9 → A1 → A3 → A2 → A5 → A10 → A11 → A7`

## Seam resolution policy (how the Captain integrates your work)
- Owned `styles/*.css`: concat (existing split + your layer; yours wins on overlap).
- `main.tsx`: aggregator import kept; meaningful wrappers (`<A11yProvider>`) adopted.
- `package.json`: deps/scripts unioned, lockfile regenerated. `tailwind.config.js`: A8.
- Backend new routers: Captain registers in `api/routes/__init__.py` (films ✅, library ✅).
- Alembic: Captain keeps a single head (A5 cover migration `e843aa7682b2` ✅).
- `coordination/`: STATUS/MERGE-LOG = Captain; CONTRACTS = folded; requests/artifacts = yours.

## Remaining toward DoD (Captain)
- [ ] Re-merge sweep as agents advance (continuous).
- [ ] When agents are feature-complete: run the app end-to-end (login → 100-book library →
      open book → fallback film + scroll-scrub → reading prefs/read-aloud → settings) +
      capture walkthrough/screenshots → `coordination/artifacts/agent-12/`.
- [ ] Remove dead `lucide-react` once no importers; verify/retire re-export shims.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` + squash/merge plan `overnight/integration` → `main` (operator review).

## Captain rail checklist (t0) — DONE
- [x] coordination scaffolding · [x] index.css → styles/ split + postcss-import aggregator
- [x] api.ts primitives · [x] gate green · [x] GO announced · [x] all 11 first-merged
