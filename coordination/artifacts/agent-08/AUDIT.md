# Kinora desktop — accessibility audit (Agent 06)

Target: **WCAG 2.2 AA** (AAA for reading text where feasible). Tooling: `@axe-core/playwright`
(real Chromium) + manual keyboard/structure review. Re-run: `pnpm --filter @kinora/desktop test:a11y`.

## Automated axe-core scan (WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 A + AA)

| Surface | Owner | Serious/critical (full scan) | Report |
|---|---|---|---|
| Owned reading surfaces (ReadingControls + ReadAloudView) | A06 | **0** | `axe-owned-reading-surfaces.json` |
| Keyboard shortcut cheat-sheet (dialog) | A06 | **0** | `axe-owned-cheatsheet.json` |
| Login screen (`/`, real app, demo mode) | A11 | **0** | `axe-login-full.json` |
| Home screen (`/`, real app, demo books) | A05 | **0** | `axe-app-home.json` |
| Reading room (real `ReadingRoom`, opened from Home) | A10 | **0** | `axe-app-reading-room.json` |
| Library (real `LibraryPage` via harness) | A05 | **2** (filed → agent-05) | `axe-app-library.json` |

**Agent 06 owned surfaces: zero serious/critical everywhere.** Login, Home, and the live
reading room scan clean. The only serious findings are 2 on the **library** (Agent 5’s
`BookShelf`/`LibraryPage`): `color-contrast` (inactive filter chips) +
`scrollable-region-focusable` (the shelf scroller / non-focusable `BookCard`) — filed in
`requests/agent-05.md`.

> Live library/reading-room are scanned via the real app in demo mode (login enters even
> when the backend is down; Home/Library render static demo books; the reading room shows
> placeholder text). The library uses the harness (`e2e/harness/library.html`) because the
> in-app page switch is flaky headless — it mounts the **real** `LibraryPage`, so the scan
> is genuine.

### Issues found + fixed during the scan
1. **`color-contrast` (serious)** — the voice `<select>` inherited light text on the UA
   white default (1.28:1). Fixed: explicit dark background in `ReadingControls`.
2. **Keyboard shortcuts swallowed by sliders** — `isTypingTarget` treated every `<input>`
   as text-entry, so `?` didn’t open the cheat-sheet while a range slider had focus.
   Fixed: only true text-entry fields (text/search/email/textarea/contenteditable…)
   suppress single-key shortcuts. (+ regression tests.)

## Keyboard-only walkthrough (recorded)
- `recordings/keyboard-flow-open-read-close.webm` — the full DoD flow with **no mouse**:
  Enter on “Open book” → focus-trapped reading dialog → adjust Text size with arrows →
  start read-aloud (word highlight advances in lockstep) → Escape closes + focus returns
  to the opener. Composed from Agent 06’s pieces (ReadingControls + ReadAloudView +
  trapFocus) as Agent 10 will integrate them (`e2e/harness/reading.html`).
- `recordings/keyboard-walkthrough.webm` — skip link → Text-size slider via arrows →
  `?` cheat-sheet (focus trapped) → Escape.

## Read-aloud word-sync (recorded)
`recordings/readaloud-wordsync.webm` + `wordsync-1/2.png` — the real `useTts` + `ReadAloudView`
highlight each word in lockstep with `boundary` events (here driven by a scripted speech
engine, since headless Chromium has no TTS voices; on a real Mac the same code runs against
OS voices with audible speech). Behavior is also locked by 17 unit tests.

## Manual / structural findings (filed as requests)
- **agent-10** (reading room): mount `<ReadingControls>` (replace inline popover); trap
  focus in the dialog; `useReducedMotionPref()`; mount `<ReadAloudView>` for word-sync;
  `<main id="kinora-main">` landmark.
- **agent-04** (motion): migrate 5 `useReducedMotion()` sites → `useReducedMotionPref()`.
- **agent-08** (tokens): focus-ring token, reading-text AA/AAA contrast, high-contrast +
  reduce-transparency selectors, light-on-dark control fix pattern.
- **agent-09** (nav/settings): `aria-current` on active tab; profile dropdown Escape +
  focus return; Accessibility settings section.
- **agent-05** (library), **agent-11** (login, already clean), **agent-01** (optional
  playhead→word stream for narration-synced highlighting).

## What Agent 06 shipped (owned, all green)
Centralized `src/a11y/` (reduced-motion source of truth, focus trap/restore, live-region
announcer, global keyboard layer + `?` cheat-sheet, VisuallyHidden, reading prefs incl.
dyslexia font, read-aloud engine + view) · `styles/a11y.css` (`.sr-only`, global
`:focus-visible`, reduced-motion/-transparency/-contrast + forced-colors, OpenDyslexic
`@font-face`) · `reading/ReadingControls.tsx` · `a11y-checklist.md`.
92 unit tests + 5 e2e; `typecheck` + `build` green.
